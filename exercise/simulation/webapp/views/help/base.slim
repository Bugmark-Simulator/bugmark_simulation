h2 Bugmark Trader Exercise

p The Trader Exercise is the second in a series of studies:

ul
  li in the <b>Worker Exercise</b> participants complete simple tasks

  li in the <b>Funder Exercise</b> participants take the Funder role

  li in the <b>Trader Exercise</b> participants perform arbitrage, sell
     partial work and set prices

p The objective of the Trader Exercise is for participants to trade partial
  work and earn money.  We also want feedback to improve the experience for
  follow-on studies.  In this study, everyone will
  fund tasks and then work on tasks.

p The Trader Exercise will run over a period of 3-5 days.

h3 The Funder Role

p Our Exercise Leader, #{TS.leader_name} (#{TS.leader_email}) may fund an
  initial set of Offers to pay a reward if an
  <a href='http://#{TS.tracker_url}' target='_blank'>Issue</a> closed
  before a specific time.

p <b>ALSO</b> each Participant will fund offers.  Participants are given a seed
  fund of 200 tokens to create Offers.

p About the <b>FUNDING HOLD:</b> each participant must fund <b>five</b>
  offers before being able to accept offers as a Worker.

h3 The Worker Role

p Once five offers have been created, all participants will act as Workers.
  As a Worker, you can browse the <a href='/issues'>open issues</a> and select
  one or more that fit
  your interest.  When you select an open offer, you form a
  <a href='/contract' target='_blank'>Contract</a> that will pay a reward if the
  <a href='http://#{TS.tracker_url}'>Issue</a> is closed before the maturation date.

h3 Issues and Offers

p New issues are created every day after midnight Eastern time.  Every offer has an
  associated issue.  If an open offer is not accepted, it expires at midnight.

a[name='contracts']
h3 Contracts

p When you accept an offer, a contract is formed.  If the issue is closed
  before the maturation date, the Worker gets the reward.  If a
  contract is formed and the Issue is not closed before the maturation
  date, the Contract proceeds are delivered to the Trader.

h3 Contract Maturation Cycle

p All offers mature daily at midnight #{timezone}. (#{eod_words} from now)
p New issues are automatically generated after midnight.

h3 Exercise Currency

p The experiment will be run using tokens, which map to real money (U.S.
  dollars). At the end of the experiment participants will receive their total
  earnings in U.S. dollars paid in the form of Amazon gift cards. The exchange
  rate is 1 USD = 10 tokens.

h3 Exercise Setup

p The setup of the experiments is as follows.

ul
  li
    | The issues in the repository consist of a mix of different task
      types such as python programming questions, documentation issues, essay
      questions, html tag removal, and scrambled words. This set of task
      types has been chosen to reflect the kinds of work done in an open source
      ecosystem.
  li
    | Each issue is listed in Bugmark as a pre-funded open offer worth 20 tokens.
  li
    | Workers must simply decide which offers to accept and work on.
  li
    | In order to get paid, the work must be satisfactorily completed by the
      maturation date which is always set to midnight Eastern Time.
  li
    | The merit of the work submitted is judged by the repository maintainers
      (as in any open source project).
  li
    | After the maturation is reached, if the issue is closed, the worker account
      balance is paid 20 tokens. Note that it may take time for
      the submitted work to be evaluated by the repo maintainer.
  li
    | Metrics measured in this experiment are: number of issues opened, number
      of issues closed, average earnings, top earnings, time taken to complete
      issues.

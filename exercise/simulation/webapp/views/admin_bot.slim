    em value: probability pair
    div This field is a list of values with their respective probabilities.
    div  Probabilities are calculated as a fraction of the sum of all probabilities.
    .my-3
      strong Example:
      pre.p-1[style="border-left: 2px solid #ccc"] prices:
        &nbsp;&nbsp;'0.80': 50

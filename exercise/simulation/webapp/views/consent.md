## Study Participants

You are invited to participate in this research study. The information in this consent
form is provided to help you make an informed decision whether or not to participate.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

If you decide to participate in the study, you will be asked to participate in up to four
60-minute  sessions.  We  will  offer  several  sessions  and  you  can  choose  the  most
convenient  time.  During  the  first  three  sessions,  you  will  be  using  a  software
prototype on a computer that we provide. The prototype will be the same in each
session but content you are interacting with will be constantly changing. We will be
tracking your behavior within the software and ask you at the end of each session to
answer a few questions. The optional fourth session would be an interview about
your experience using the prototype.

Participation in the study is voluntary. You have the right to change your mind at any
time. You may stop participating in the study without penalty and without giving a
reason.  Your  enrollment  status  or  class  performance  will  be  unaffected  by
participating.  Your  participation  will  be  anonymous  and  we  collect  your  personal
information only to communicate with you about scheduling sessions and to provide
you with an Amazon gift card as a token of appreciation for your participation. The
value  of  the  Amazon  gift  card  will  be  determined  by  how  many  sessions  you
participated in.

The results of the research study will not be of use to you, and you will not be told
individual  results.  We  may  share  the  full  anonymous  research  dataset  with
collaborators. If you like to receive a final study report, you are free to let us know.
If you have any questions about the rights as a research participant, please contact
the  principal  investigator  Georg  Link  via  glink@unomaha.edu,  the  secondary
investigator  Vinod  Ahuja  via  vahuja@unomaha.edu,  or  the  faculty  supervisor:  Dr.
Matt Germonprez via germonprez@gmail.com.

You can only participate if you consent. By clicking "I consent to participate" within

was explained to you, you have read and understood the consent form, that your
questions have been answered, and that you decided to participate. You will receive

# Bugmark Simulation Platform

## Description

The Bugmark Simulation Platform is a system for research purposes. The system builds on the [Bugmark Exchange](https://github.com/bugmark/exchange) and adapts [Test_Bench](https://github.com/bugmark/test_bench/). The system architecture consists of the Bugmark Exchange, an Issue Tracker, several Scripts for automated behavior, and the User Interface.

## Goal

The Bugmark Simulation Platform is developed for research experiments. The objective of the research is to investigate how developers conceptualize the use of Bugmark market mechanisms. Specifically, we are interested in how signals about the Market and Open Source Project Health are related and compete. For more information on the setup, please read the documentation on how to run an experiment.

## Title of this Research Study

Usability testing of a new market mechanism for peer-production

## Study Participants

You are invited to participate in this research study. The information in this consent
form is provided to help you make an informed decision whether or not to participate.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will first participate in a training session.
You have the right to change your mind and leave the study at any time without
penalty, and you need not give a reason for leaving the study. Your enrollment status
will be unaffected by participating.

Taking part in this study voluntarily. Data collected during the study will be stored
using an identifier, rather than using your name. The data collected about you in this
study will be kept private and identifiers will not be shared with anyone outside the
study. The recorded sessions will be deleted after completed analysis. Also, no
personal information will be disclosed in any publications or presentations as a result
of being in this research.

We ask that you participate in three usability studies. The software platform can be
used from anywhere with internet access. You can participate on your own time and
from any location you choose. We do not require you to travel to a specific location
but do request that you make time to join a training session for each study.

Usability study 1 is our base case. The objective is to get you using the platform,
opening and closing contracts, resolving trades successfully, and earning some
money. We also want your feedback after this study to improve the experience for the
next two studies. In this study, everyone will be workers who work on pre-funded
tasks.

Usability study 2 requires more economic reasoning on your part. You will be both
worker and trader in this study. You must then not only decide what tasks to work on
but also take on the role of funding these tasks (deciding what tasks to fund and how
much).

Usability study 3 requires advanced knowledge of trading and involves partial work
and reselling of contracts. We want to understand how information sharing and
collaboration work in a trading platform for software tasks. Specifically, our
hypothesis is that such a trading platform facilitates information sharing and
collaboration.

Prior to each study we will offer a training session to familiarize you with the new
functionality that you will use. The training will be recorded and available to you at all
times. We will also prepare a FAQ and written instructions for the software prototype.
After each study, we will send out a survey asking "What did you find easy? What did
you struggle with?" Other evaluations include trace data from the transaction history
in our software prototype.

The results of these research studies will not be of any use to you, and you will not
be told individual results. If you like to receive the final study trackerrt, you are free to
ask us for it.

If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant, please contact
the principal investigator Georg Link via email at glink@unomaha.edu, the secondary
investigators Malvika Rao via email at malvikar@gmail.com, Andy Leak via email at
andy@r210.com, or the faculty supervisor Dr. Matt Germonprez via email at

By checking the box when creating your account for the software prototype, you
agree to have read this consent form and voluntarily decided to participate.
